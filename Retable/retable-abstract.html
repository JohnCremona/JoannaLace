<H1>The Retable of St. Paul</H1>
<H2 align=left>Abstract</H2>
<P>
The retable is made up of a central panel of St. Paul Enthroned
surrounded by ten smaller painted scenes, eight of which illustrate
the main events of his life, from his conversion to his death. The
panels are painted in differing styles, and analysis shows that all
stem from sources traceable to northern Italy, and dated between the
last third of the fourteenth century and the beginning of the
fifteenth. The same applies to the two upper subsidiary panels that
were later overpainted. Figure styles, backgrounds, and differing
painting techniques are identified with various concurrent trends:
Veneto-Byzantine, Lombard, and north-European - the latter reflecting
Franco-Flemish work emanating from the great northern centres of
patronage. In particular, abstract patterns seen on clothing,
furnishings, flooring and backgrounds, are traced individually to
named artists. These artists form part of a total of twelve - for
convenience they are designated the 'Veneto Group' - all belonging to
the generation following that of Guariento di Arpo (documented
1338-1370), and each relating to a particular aspect of the
retable. The St. Paul retable was thus a collaborative work, and
typical of the current 'international' milieu. In addition,
the later overpainting of certain scenes provides valuable insights
into developments in northern Italy in the painting of figures and of
their setting within a realistic landscape, during what was an
important formative period.
